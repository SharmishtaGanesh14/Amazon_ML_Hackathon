# Amazon ML Challenge 2025 - Multimodal Product Price Prediction

A sophisticated multimodal machine learning pipeline that predicts product prices using both textual descriptions and product images. This solution combines advanced NLP techniques, computer vision, and ensemble modeling to achieve accurate price predictions.

## üèÜ Competition Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Amazon ML Challenge 2025, which focused on predicting product prices using multimodal data (text + images). The challenge required handling real-world e-commerce data with varying quality text descriptions and product images.
